== Natours Project

* used for polygon sizing for `clip-path` property: https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/
* for browser performance, it's best to only animate 2 different properties (browsers are optimized for this)
** opacity (`0` or `1`)
** transform
* css animation might have a shake, but just use `backface-visibility: hidden;` and it should work without shake
+
IMPORTANT: `backface-visibility` fixes all the weird quirks of CSS anitmations...
+
* apply transitions to initial state (link/visited)
* apply keyframe `0%` first: `animation-fill-mode: backwards`

==== The visual formatting model

* def: algorithm that calculates boxes and determines  the layout of these boxes, for each element in the render tree, in order to determine the final layout of the page
** combines all the information below to determine the view for the user
*** dimensions of boxes: the box model
*** box type: inline, block, and inline-block
*** positioning scheme: floats and positioning
*** stacking contexts
*** other elements in the render tree
*** viewport size, dimensions of images, etc...

.different type of boxes to use

* for float positioning, use clefixes? for resizing things when in float state

.different types of positioning
image:Screenshot_20211212_122724.png[different types of positioning]

* stacking contexts
** `z-index`: highest number = highest layer & lowest value (including negative) = lowest
** other properties: opacity, transform, or filter can also affect stacking context

==== CSS Architecture, components & BEM

===== Think

* *think* about the layout of your webpage or web app before writing code
* component driven design
** modular building blocks that make up interfaces
** held together by the layout of the page
** re-usable across a project, and between different projects
** independent, allowing us to use them anywhere on the page
* atomic design (organisms = components)

===== Build

* *build* your layout in HTML and CSS with a consistent structure for naming classes
* BEM
** **B**lock **E**lement **M**odifier
+
.visual format
----
.block {}
.block__element {}
.block__element--modifier {}
----
+
** *BLOCK*: standalone component that is meaningful on its own
+
image:Screenshot_20211212_124131.png[block example]
+
** *ELEMENT*: part of a block that has no standalone meaning
+
image:Screenshot_20211212_124206.png[element example]
+
** *MODIFIER*: a different version of a block or an element
+
image:Screenshot_20211212_124237.png[modifier example]

===== Architecture

* create a logical *architecture* for your CSS with files and folders
* the 7-1 pattern
** 7 different folders for partial Sass files, and
** 1 main Sass file to import all other files into
** a compiled CSS stylesheet
** replace Sass w/any other CSS pre-processor
+
image:Screenshot_20211212_124822.png[seven folders structure]

== SASS

* Sass is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS that add power and elegance to the basic language
* Sass source code -> Sass compiler -> compiled CSS code
+
.main features
image:Screenshot_20211212_125915.png[main features image]
+
* different Sass things (https://codepen.io/elrey741/pen/bGoBRPV)
** `$color-primary: #f9ed69;` = creating a variable
** nesting same as `.navigation li: {}`
+
----
.navigation {
  list-style: none;

  li {

  }
----
+
** easily repeat nesting path with `&`, which is necessary for nesting psuedo elements (i.e. `&:first-child`)
** should probably go deeper than 3 levels of nesting
** mixin: reusable piece of code (i.e. huge variable with multiple lines of code)
*** can take arguments
** function: takes arguments and then returns information
*** if want to _cast_ to pixel use this: `margin: divide(60,2) * 1px;`
** placeholder + extend: write a placeholder, and then have a bunch of selectors extend place holder
*** instead of mixin (pasting code wherever used), extends replaces a placeholder with the current selector (i.e. .btn--hot:link)
*** only use extend if selectors are inherently and thematically related (i.e. a set of similar buttons)
*** normally prefers mixins

.basics in responsive design
image:Screenshot_20211212_191837.png[]

.different project layouts
image:Screenshot_20211212_192000.png[]

* create rows of grid like image below
+
.float layout we weill create
image:Screenshot_20211212_192402.png[]
+
* center row in viewport with: `margin: 0 auto;` for block elements
** figures out automatic sizing for left and right with the `auto` keyword
* inside css functions (i.e. `calc()`) when wanting to use a Sass variable wrap with: `#{}`
* clearfix hack for when element losses height from floats
* `-webkit-background-clip: text;` - clips background excatly where the text is
* https://github.com/linea-io/Linea-Iconset for icon font.
* `<i>` used to be for italics, but now people use it for icons instead
* used to cover entire section with background image: `background-size: cover;`
* direct child selector for Sass `& > *`
* `perspective` is used to help make the transform come towards the user
** use a high value, or else get weird effect (i.e. 1500px or 150rem)
** `-moz-perspective` - for firefox
* background blend mode - used for blending multiple background images

NOTE: don't nest Scss if not a child of the element, and it's a completely different element (i.e. no modifier)

* `box-decoration-break: clone` - used for cloneing properties applied to initial box to all boxes created (i.e. when text has line break makes padding equal on all side of line break)
* sometimes looks good when you have big font that you also make it thinner
* `clip-path` - breaks border radius, so need to assign manually
* `circle()`
** `50%` - radius
* height/width needed for shape outside property
* best way to move an object with float is using transform/translate
* because image can be too big with width 100% (it'll not look right) you can sometime do height 100% instead
* no way to have 2 transform properties at the same time
* filter `brightness()` - below 100% makes image darker above 100% makes lighter
* solid gradient: linear gradients 1st color: 0%-50%, 2nd color: 50%
** can use transparent as color
* direct/adjacent sibling selector: `+` (just like in emmet)
* general sibling selector: `~`
** used if element is a sibling, but not directly a sibling (i.e. right next to it, but lower down after another element)
* use opacity 0 & visiblity hidden if you want it to disappear and not be visible
** cannot annimate visbility, but you can animate opacity
* no way to style radio buttons, instead create a span element that looks like button is getting selected instead and hid the builtin input button
* navigation menu
** checkbox hack & how it works
** create custom animation timing functions using cubic bezier curves
** animate solid-color gradients
** how & why to use `transform-origin``

== Responsive Images

* 3 use cases for responsive images
** Resolution switching
*** Large screen -> small screen (decrease image resolution on smaller screen)
** density switching
*** like resolution switching, but the amount of physical pixels displayed is different
*** 2x screens (high-res) say want 100px they'll use 200px to display the image
*** serve higher resolution screens higher quality images
** art direction
*** different image on a smaller screen (only the important parts) serve completely different image

* `srcset` attribute on `<img>` and `<source>` elements for density switching
* using `<picture>` for art direction
* css vs html images
** css: background images
** regular image tags and logos
* `srcset` attribute, width descriptors, and the `sizes` attribute of the `<img>` element
* `min-resolution: 192dpi` - display density of apple retina screen (normally the reference)

== Browser support

* caniuse.com
* graceful degredation with `@supports`` rule
* `backdrop-filter`

== Build process for SASS

compilation -> concatenation -> prefixing -> compression -> production

== Flexbox

* best for 1d layouts and replaces float
* info about flexbox
** flex container - `display: flex` or `display: flex-inline`
** flex items
** main axis (left -> right)
** cross axis (top -> bottom)
** flex-direction ( affects main axis )
** justify-content ( how aligned on main axis )
** align-items ( how aligned on cross axis )
** align-content ( more than one row of content )
* all flex order items start at 0
** flex gorw is relative to other flex items grow value
* instead of width use `flex-basis`
+
image:Screenshot_20220223_102130.png[flexbox]
+
* custom properties instead of sass variables
* css variables instead of SASS
** manipulated in JS
** edit them in dev tools
** used in calc function
** are inherited
* `:root` psuedo-class allows access to variables in whole document
* use SVG instead of icon fonts
** icon fonts fail more often than wanted, and doens't look right
* svg stuff
** sprite file (symbol-defs.svg) - has all the different svgs defined, so we can use only one file for all the icons
* `margin-right: auto` - span all possible flexbox space till next item
* masks
** can be used to "color" icons/svgs
** use `-webkit-mask-image` and set the `url()` to be the svg you want
** make sure to use `-webkit-mask-size: cover` to help SVG fit the height/width of mask
